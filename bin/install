## Homebrew packages

# Homebrew will not break on installing if the current version is installed.
# Yet it will break if there is a new version available.
#
# When we put two commands in order, the second command only runs when the first
# fails.  Yet it has a nasty "Error" when we try to upgrade, thus 2>/dev/null the
# upgrade error.
