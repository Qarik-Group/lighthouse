# Lighthouse

Lighthouse, near friendly shores.

With lighthouse, you can run a quick series of readiness tests to make sure things will be able to have a safe harbor on your Cloud Foundry platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install the following command-line tools.

* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

```

### Authorize Safe

3. Create a target to safe.

```

4. Then login to safe, with a token.

safe auth
```

You've completed the **Getting Started** and are now ready to use Lighthouse!

## Usage

Let's first run a command to test that tool is connected to your authencation backend.

```bash
make check
```

TODO: add what a "good" `make check` looks like.

Once set up, flip the switch and turn on your lighthouse.  Run `make all` to run your tests and light the way home.

```bash
make all
```
