# Lighthouse

Lighthouse, near friendly shores.

With lighthouse, you can run a quick series of tests to make sure things will be able to have a safe harbor on your Cloud Foundry platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install the following command-line tools.

* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
* [cf-cli](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
* [bosh-cli](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/)
* [safe](https://github.com/starkandwayne/safe#attention-homebrew-users)
* [uaa](docs/install-uaa.md)

### Get Software

2. Clone this repo to your local computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krutten/lighthouse.git
```

### Configure

3. Make a copy of the `config.env.example` file.

```bash
$ cp config.env.example config.env
```

4. Provide the required settings to the Vault backend by replacing all the `"replace-me"` values.

```bash
export VAULT_PATH="replace-me"
export VAULT_TOKEN="replace-me"
export VAULT_ADDR="replace-me"
export VAULT_ALIAS="replace-me"
export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=1
```

* `VAULT_PATH` is the beginning of the path to your secrets.  Like `secret/c-g6`.
* `VAULT_TOKEN` is a alpha-numeric authentication and authorization token.
* `VAULT_ADDR` is the IP address or FQDN to your vault.
* `VAULT_ALIAS` is the name of the target for safe to use. For example: `sandbox`, `pre-prod`, `prod`.
* `VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY` will skip the check for a TLS verification.

### Login

Tests can be run from the commandline with the `bin/lh` script.  Yet you'll need to login first.

5. Login to `safe`, `bosh-cli`, and `cf-cli`.

```bash
bin/lh login
```
