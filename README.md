# Lighthouse

Lighthouse, near friendly shores.

With lighthouse, you can run a quick series of readiness tests to make sure things will be able to have a safe harbor on your Cloud Foundry platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the following command-line tools.

* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
* [cf-cli](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
* [bosh-cli](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/)
* [safe]()
* [make]

### Get Software

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krutten/lighthouse.git
```

### Ensure they are logged into safe

TODO ...

Give error messsages about config if they are not logged in.

## Usage

Once set up, flip the switch and turn on your lighthouse.  Run `make all` to run your tests and light the way home.

```bash
make all
```
